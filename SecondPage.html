<h1> My short Story! </h1>
  <body>
    She studied her face in the mirror. How could this happen.. She reached up and covered the left end of her face, watching as skin began to peel off. ̈Amber it’s time to go to school sweetheart!¨, her mother screamed. Amber could hear her voice travel up the winding stair case. She took in a deep breath as she mustered up the strength to see what her face had become. With a swift movement she yanked her hand from her face and placed her it on the bathroom sink. Wide-eyed she almost screamed in horror. Her face had blackened into a shadow like state.
Amber began to shake as she reached up to touch what was once her face. Her hand began to slide right through the nonexistent layer of skin. Flowers began to sprout from her left eye socket, what was happening to her! She thought. Her mom frustrated by the rate it was taking to get ready thrust the bathroom door open. Amber’s mom began to scream. Amber began to scream as the black substance that was once just on her face, now covered her whole body. She no longer felt like herself, it was like she became something else of the cosmos. She took in a deep breath, and began to study her face in the mirror once more.
 She was new, she was different… Her mother was nowhere to be seen, everything was now white. She looked down seeing her arms and legs planets lining from her toes to her waist. Glancing down she saw where her heart once was, revealing a nebula. She was now the galaxy as a whole. She closed her eyes and accepted her newly bound fate.
